# Movies-ETL
---
The purpose of this project was to learn and practice using the Extract, Tranform, Load pipeline by cleaning and merging movie datasets.  First, a raw json file of wikipedia movie data and several csv files of kaggle movie metadata were loaded into Pandas dataframes and cleaned.  Then the data was merged together into a more clean and complete movies dataframe, which was subsequently added to a SQL database in order to be easily used in future queries.
